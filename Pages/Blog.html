	<p style = "margin: 0px" >The evolution of technology has dramatically changed society. An endless number of people all over the world use and benefit from modern technology, and the tremendous opportunities it provides play a significant role in almost all fields of human life. Technology has simplified the access to many necessary tools people need in education, industry, medicine, communication, transportation, and so on. However, excessive usage of technology has its drawbacks as well...<br><span class ="less"></span><span id ="more">
	Though, in most cases, the speed of fulfilling tasks accelerates with the help of technology, many people do not realize that technology negatively affectssociety, and its considerable development has complicated life in a number of different ways. Technology has weakened the relations among family members. Busy with diverse devices, family members cannot have such convivial atmosphere as they used to in the past. Before the invention of these devices, family members would sit together around the table and play gamestogether.However, since the invention of video games, those kinds of entertainment have changed to games played individually, and the impact of such games on family relations is apparent. Nowadaysinstead of watching TV together or eating a family meal, everyone in the family isin a separate room, either playing video games, watching football or just typing messages. Though, in some cases, technology helps parents to communicate with their children and know their location, it is not always enough for children’s safety just to stay connected with the family.</span></p>

	<h3><b>Misuse Of technology</b></h3>
	<h5>Poshan Bhandari, <span class ="opacity">April 25, 2019</span></h5>
</div>

<div class ="container2">
	<p style = "margin: 0px">Technology has become much more accessible. However, as more people are able to access technological developments, more people are able to misuse it. The anonymity afforded to users has led to outpouring of support and provided a view into the worst parts of ourselves. One of the biggest challenges with technology is that the more negative aspects of ourselves are starting to radiate out to younger users. The most prevalent technology that is affecting young users is the cellphone.<br>
 <span class= "less"></span> <span id ="more1">
	Cellphones have the capacity to be the greatest technologically driven tool in modern history. We depend on them for news, they replace watches, radios, and calculators, and they entertain us in all the gaps of lost time.Foreign languages are less intimidating because we can (for the most part) use our phone to access the internet and make ourselves understood.The problem with this is that as children gain access to these devices, they get to access an adult’s world without a filter. No guardian makes sure they do not accidentally find some aspect of sexuality or violence that is not presented in an age appropriate manner. While growing up with technology has made the development seem more natural, I cannot help but recognize that life would have been very different for me had I been given a smart phone earlier than I had. Even now, I struggle with the addictive nature of the device. It is super easy to check social media, and studies have shown that viewing positive responses to our posts of social media trigger parts of the brain to release the biochemicals that make us happy. We thrive on those miniature rewards, and chase them down when we do not feel happy. As teenagers, having access to that constant approval is a heady feeling.</span></p>

	<h3><b>Uses Of technology In Education And Teaching</b></h3>

<div class ="container2">
	<p style = "margin: 0px">The effective Use of Technology in Education has changed the face of education and it has created more educational opportunities. Both teachers and students have benefited from various educational technologies, teachers have learned how to integrate technology in their classrooms and students are getting more interested in learning with technology. The use of technology in education has removed educational boundaries, both students and teachers can collaborate in real time using advanced educational technologies.<br><span id ="less"></span> <span id= "more2">
	Technology has helped in the growth of mobile learning and long distance learning. The use of internet technology has enabled teachers to reach students across boarders and also students from developing countries have used internet technology to subscribe for advanced educational courses.<br> Many universities and colleges have embraced online education by creating virtual classrooms. Online education is flexible and affordable, students can attend classrooms during their free time, and they can also have a chance to interact with other students virtually.Recent advancements in educational technologies have yielded positive results in our education sector. This new educational technology is supporting both teaching and learning processes, technology has digitized classrooms through digital learning tools like, computers, iPads, smartphones, smart digital white boards; it has expanded course offerings, it has increased student’s engagement and motivation towards learning.</span></p>

	<h3><b>Artificial Intelligence</b></h3>
	<h5>Poshan Bhandari, <span class ="opacity">April 26, 2019</span></h5>
</div>

<div class ="container2">
	<p style = "margin: 0px">From SIRI to self-driving cars, artificial intelligence (AI) is progressing rapidly. While science fiction often portrays AI as robots with human-like characteristics, AI can encompass anything from Google’s search algorithms to IBM’s Watson to autonomous weapons.<br>

	Artificial intelligence today is properly known as narrow AI (or weak AI), in that it is designed to perform a narrow task . However, the long-term goal of many researchers is to create general AI (AGI or strong AI). While narrow AI may outperform humans at whatever its specific task is, like playing chess or solving equations, AGI would outperform humans at nearly every cognitive task.<span id ="less"></span> <span id= "more3"><br>
	 Autonomous weapons are artificial intelligence systems that are programmed to kill. In the hands of the wrong person, these weapons could easily cause mass casualties. Moreover, an AI arms race could inadvertently lead to an AI war that also results in mass casualties. To avoid being thwarted by the enemy, these weapons would be designed to be extremely difficult to simply “turn off,” so humans could plausibly lose control of such a situation. This risk is one that’s present even with narrow AI, but grows as levels of AI intelligence and autonomy increase.</span></p>
